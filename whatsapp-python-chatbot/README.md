## 📁 Project Structure

```
/whatsapp-python-chatbot/
├── script.py         # Main Flask application and bot logic
├── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
├── .env              # Environment variables (API keys, etc.)
├── persona.json      # Customizable AI personality settings
└── README.md         # This file
```

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or create the files as described.**

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root directory by copying the example below. **Do not commit your `.env` file to version control if it contains sensitive keys.**

    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"  # Free tier: 1500 requests/month
    WASENDER_API_TOKEN="YOUR_WASENDER_API_TOKEN_HERE"  # $6/month subscription
    # Optional: If you change the port in script.py, update it here too for ngrok or other services
    # FLASK_RUN_PORT=5000
    ```

    Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys:

    - `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your API key for the Gemini API (free tier available)
    - `WASENDER_API_TOKEN`: Your API token from WaSenderAPI ($6/month subscription)

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

### 1. Development Mode (using Flask's built-in server)

This is suitable for local development and testing.

```bash
python3 script.py
```

The application will typically run on `http://0.0.0.0:5001/` by default.

### 2. Using ngrok for Webhook Testing

WaSenderAPI needs to send webhook events (incoming messages) to a publicly accessible URL. If you're running the Flask app locally, `ngrok` can expose your local server to the internet.

a. **Install ngrok** (if you haven't already) from [https://ngrok.com/](https://ngrok.com/).

b. **Start ngrok** to forward to your Flask app's port (e.g., 5001):

```bash
ngrok http 5001
```

c. **ngrok will provide you with a public URL** (e.g., `https://xxxx-xx-xxx-xxx-xx.ngrok-free.app`).

d. **Configure this ngrok URL as your webhook URL** in the WaSenderAPI dashboard for your connected device/session. Make sure to append the `/webhook` path (e.g., `https://xxxx-xx-xxx-xxx-xx.ngrok-free.app/webhook`).

### 3. Production Deployment (using Gunicorn)

For production, it's recommended to use a proper WSGI server like Gunicorn instead of Flask's built-in development server.

a. **Install Gunicorn:**

```bash
pip3 install gunicorn
```

b. **Run the application with Gunicorn:**
Replace `script:app` with `your_filename:your_flask_app_instance_name` if you change them.

```bash
gunicorn --workers 4 --bind 0.0.0.0:5001 script:app
```

- `--workers 4`: Adjust the number of worker processes based on your server's CPU cores (a common starting point is `2 * num_cores + 1`).
- `--bind 0.0.0.0:5001`: Specifies the address and port Gunicorn should listen on.

c. **Reverse Proxy (Recommended):**
In a typical production setup, you would run Gunicorn behind a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache. The reverse proxy would handle incoming HTTPS requests, SSL termination, static file serving (if any), and forward requests to Gunicorn.

## 🔄 WaSenderAPI Webhook Configuration

- Log in to your WaSenderAPI dashboard.
- Navigate to the session management section.
- connect you phone number to the session.
- Find the option to set or update the webhook URL.
- Enter the publicly accessible URL where your Flask application's `/webhook` endpoint is running (e.g., your ngrok URL during development, or your production server's URL).
- make sure you only select only **message_upsert**.
- seve the changes.

## 📝 Customizing Your Bot's Personality

The chatbot includes a customizable base prompt that defines the AI's persona and behavior. Edit the `persona.json` file to change how Gemini responds to messages, making the bot more formal, casual, informative, or conversational as needed for your use case.

```json
{
  "name": "WhatsApp Assistant",
  "base_prompt": "You are a helpful and concise AI assistant replying in a WhatsApp chat...",
  "description": "You are a helpful WhatsApp assistant. Keep your responses concise..."
}
```

## 📊 Logging and Error Handling

- The application uses Python's built-in `logging` module.
- Logs are printed to the console by default.
- Log format: `%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s`.
- Unhandled exceptions are also logged.
- **Important for Production:** Consider configuring logging to write to files, use a centralized logging service (e.g., ELK stack, Sentry, Datadog), and implement log rotation.
